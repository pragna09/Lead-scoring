1.Which of the following sample has the greatest standard deviation?
a. 98 104 100 101 102
b. 20 4 6 8 10
c. 2 10 5 10
d. 1 5 3 2
a
c
d
sol:b

2.For the following dataset determine the variance and standard deviation of the Age and Rating.

import pandas as pd

#Create a Dictionary of series
d = {'Name':pd.Series(['Emma','James','Ricky','Vera','Steve','Smith','Jack',
   'Eva','Chanchal','Gasper','Maria','Andrew']),
   'Age':pd.Series([19,26,25,33,30,29,23,34,40,55,25,46]),
   'Rating':pd.Series([4.29,3.24,3.98,3.56,1.20,2.66,3.8,3.78,2.98,4.80,4.10,3.65])}

#Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(d)
sol:VAR : Age = 108.265 and Rating = 0.857
sol:STD : Age = 10.405 and Rating = 0.926
STD : Age = 11.402 and Rating = 0.996
VAR : Age = 8.265 and Rating = 1.345

3.Computing the variance for the Datasaurus Dozen Dataset

The "Datasaurus Dozen" dataset contains 13 datasets, each with a different shape but the same summary statistics. Import the datasaurus.csv using pandas as df.

Once you have imported the dataset, you can compute the variance for each dataset.
The variance is almost similar for all the dataset

4.Find the standard deviation of the average temperatures recorded over a five-day period last winter

temperature= [18, 22, 19, 25, 12]
23.7
94.80
sol:4.35

5.What happens to a variance or standard deviation when a constant is added? What if the variance and standard deviation is multiplied by a constant.
Variability decrease when a constant is added but multiplying by a constant changes the variability.
sol:Variability stays the same when a constant is added but multiplying by a constant changes the variability.
Variability increase when a constant is added but multiplying by a constant changes the variability.
