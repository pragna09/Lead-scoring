1.Decide whether a continuous (C) random variable is the best for each of the following variables:
sol:The temperature of a cup of coffee served at a restaurant.
sol:The volume of gasoline that is lost to evaporation during the filling of a gas tank.
Number of heads when flipping three coins.
sol:The time until a projectile returns to Earth.

2.Identify the type of random variable and the set of possible values for each random variable. (Make a reasonable estimate based on experience, where necessary.)
The number of heads in two tosses of a coin.
sol:Discrete random variables
Continuous random variables

3.Identify the type of random variable and the set of possible values for each random variable. (Make a reasonable estimate based on experience, where necessary.)
The amount of liquid in a 12 -ounce can of soft drink.
sol:Continuous random variables
Discrete random variables

4.Consider a game where a fair six-sided die is rolled.
Complete the function and run it in the notebook. The function should return a random integer between 1 and 6 (both inclusive).

sol:
def roll_die():
    return np.random.randint(1,7)


5.Consider a scenario where a coin is flipped.Complete the function and execute it in the notebook. The function should return 0 or 1.
sol:
def flip_coin():
    return np.random.randint(0, 2)  # Generates a random integer between 0 and 1(inclusive)
