In this project, we embark on a detailed exploration of the foundational rules that govern the realm of probability, a mathematical discipline that allows us to quantify the likelihood of various events. Our journey will cover six pivotal rules, each an essential piece in the puzzle of understanding how probabilities work both in theory and in practice.

The Probability Range Rule elucidates that the probability of any given event A lies within a specific range: from 0, indicating an impossible event, to 1, indicating a certainty. This fundamental principle sets the stage for our understanding that probability quantifies uncertainty in a measurable and precise manner.

The Total Probability Rule asserts that the sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes within a sample space S equals 1. This rule is crucial for ensuring that our probability calculations accurately reflect the complete set of outcomes for any given situation.

The Complement Rule introduces us to the concept of complementary probabilities, highlighting that the probability of an event not occurring (P(Ac)) is simply 1 minus the probability of the event occurring (P(A)). This relationship provides a straightforward method for assessing the likelihood of alternative outcomes.

The Addition Rule differentiates between mutually exclusive and non-mutually exclusive events, offering formulas to calculate the probability of either event occurring. This rule is vital for understanding how to combine probabilities in scenarios where outcomes may or may not overlap.

The Multiplication Rule dives into the probability of the conjunction of events, distinguishing between dependent and independent events. It introduces the concept of conditional probability (P(A|B)), which is central to predicting the likelihood of sequential occurrences.

Conditional Probability expands upon the idea that the probability of an event can be affected by the knowledge of a preceding event's occurrence. This rule not only builds upon the Multiplication Rule but also sets the stage for understanding more complex probabilistic models.

By dissecting these rules, this project aims to provide a comprehensive framework for navigating the intricacies of probability. Through careful examination and application of these principles, we will uncover the elegant structure that underlies probabilistic thinking, enhancing our ability to make informed decisions in the face of uncertainty.

Example
! Let's dive into examples for each of the six probability rules to illustrate their application:

Rule 1: Probability Range
Example: Consider flipping a fair coin. The probability of landing heads (P(H)) is 0.5, and the probability of landing tails (P(T)) is also 0.5. Both these probabilities lie within the acceptable range of 0 ≤ P(A) ≤ 1. The event of the coin landing on its edge (assuming a standard coin) is virtually impossible, making its probability 0.
Rule 2: Total Probability
Example: In a deck of 52 cards, the probability of drawing a heart, a diamond, a spade, or a club sums up to 1, because one must draw a card that belongs to one of these suits. So, P(Heart) + P(Diamond) + P(Spade) + P(Club) = 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 1.
Rule 3: Complement Rule
Example: The probability of not drawing a king from a standard deck of cards is the complement of drawing a king. Since there are 4 kings in a deck of 52, P(King) = 4/52 = 1/13. Therefore, P(Not a King) = 1 - P(King) = 1 - 1/13 = 12/13.
Rule 4: Addition Rule
Example a (Mutually Exclusive): The probability of rolling a 5 or a 6 on a single six-sided die is P(5 or 6) = P(5) + P(6) = 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3.

Example b (Not Mutually Exclusive): The probability of drawing a card that is either a heart or a king from a standard deck of cards includes the probability of drawing a heart (P(Heart) = 13/52), the probability of drawing a king (P(King) = 4/52), and subtracting the probability of drawing the king of hearts (P(King and Heart) = 1/52), so P(Heart or King) = 13/52 + 4/52 - 1/52 = 16/52 = 4/13.

Rule 5: Multiplication Rule
Example a (Dependent Events): When drawing two cards from a deck without replacement, the probability of the first card being an ace and the second card being a king is P(Ace) × P(King|Ace) = (4/52) × (4/51) because the probability of drawing a king changes after drawing an ace first.

Example b (Independent Events): The probability of flipping two coins and both landing heads is P(Head on 1st flip) × P(Head on 2nd flip) = 1/2 × 1/2 = 1/4.

Rule 6: Conditional Probability
Example: In a bag of 10 marbles, 7 are red and 3 are blue. If one marble is drawn and it's red, the probability of drawing a blue marble next (without replacing the first marble) is P(Blue|Red) = P(Blue and Red) / P(Red) = (3/10) / (7/10) = 3/7, since the sample space is reduced to 9 marbles after the first draw.
