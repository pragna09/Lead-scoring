1.A telephone number is selected at random from a directory. Suppose X denote the last digit of selected telephone number. Find the probability that the last digit of the selected number is 6
P(X=6)=1/6
P(X=6)=1/3
P(X=6)=1/5
sol:P(X=6)=1/10

2.A telephone number is selected at random from a directory. Suppose X denote the last digit of selected telephone number. Find the probability that the last digit of the selected number is less than 3
P(X<3)=0.5
P(X<3)=0.1
P(X<3)=02
sol:P(X<3)=0.3

3.A telephone number is selected at random from a directory. Suppose X denote the last digit of selected telephone number. Find the probability that the last digit of the selected number is greater than or equal to 8
P(X≥8)=0.1
sol:P(X≥8)=0.2
P(X≥8)=0.8
P(X≥8)=0.15

4.Let X denote the number appear on the top of a die. Then X the random variable take the values {1,2,3,4,5,6} and X follows the uniform distribution.The probability mass function of random variable is
P(X=x)=1/(6−1+1)=1/6
Find the probability that the number appear on the top of the die is less than 3.
sol:P(X<3)=2/6
P(X>3)=2/6
P(X<3)=1/6
P(X<3)=4/6

5.If X is uniformly distributed over (0, 10), calculate the probability that P(3<X<8)
sol:0.5
1
0.4
0.1

6.If Y is uniformly distributed over (0, 20), calculate the probability that P(5<Y<5)
0.7
0.2
sol:0.5
0.3

7.Let the random variable X have a discrete uniform distribution on the integers 1≤x≤3.Determine the mean and variance of X 
sol:E(X)=2 and VAR(X)=0.66
E(X)=2.1 and VAR(X)=0.66
E(X)=0.66 and VAR(X)=2
