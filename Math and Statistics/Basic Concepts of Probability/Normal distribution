1.Let equal the IQ of a randomly selected Datawars student. Assume X~ N(100,16^2) What is the probability that a randomly selected student has an IQ below 90?
from scipy.stats import norm

# Mean (mu) and standard deviation (sigma)
mu = 100
sigma = 16

# Calculate the probability of having an IQ less than 90
probability = norm.cdf(x=90, loc=mu, scale=sigma)

print(f"The probability that a randomly selected student has an IQ below 90 is {probability:.4f}")
sol:The probability that a randomly selected student has an IQ below 90 is 0.2660

2.Assume that Z has a standard normal distribution. Determine P(Z>1.2)
0.89
sol:0.103

3.Assume that Z has a standard normal distribution. Determine P(Z>−0.86)
0.19
sol:0.805

4.If X is a normal random variable with parameters μ= 3 and σ^2= 9, find P(2<X<5)
0.36
0.37
sol:0.74
