import sys

sum = int(sys.argv[1]) + int(sys.argv[2])
average = (sum + int(sys.argv[3]))/2

print("Sum:", sum)
print("Average:", average)


Sum: 15
Average: 15.0


8.Create a python script

Create a Python script named print_message.py that takes a message as an argument and prints it. The script should be able to run like this:

python print_message.py "Hello, DataWars!"

9.Name it Right!

Create a Python script that defines three variables: first_name, age, and is_student. Name the file variables_activity_9.py and run it to check if the variables are created correctly.

Name the file variables_activity_9.py and run it to check if the variables are created correctly.

In the first line of the script, create a variable named first_name and assign it the value "Alice". In the second line, create a variable named age and assign it the value 25. In the third line, create a variable named is_student and assign it the value True.

In the next 3 lines, print the values of these variables using the print() function.

first_name="Alice"
age=25
is_student=True
print(first_name)
print(age)
print(is_student)


10.Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius

Write a Python script that takes the temperature in Fahrenheit as input from the user and converts it to Celsius. Create a script named temperature_converter.py and run it to check if the conversion is correct.

Use the input() function to take the temperature in Fahrenheit as input.
Convert the input to an integer.
Convert the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius using the formula: Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9.
Print the temperature in Celsius.


Fahrenheit=input("Enter the temperature in Fahrenheit:")
celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9
print(f"Temperature in Celsius: {celsius:.1f}")
