 1: Define a variable num with value 100 of integer data type
num=100

2. Define a variable score with value 100 of float data type
score=float(100)

3. Define a variable name with your name of string data type.
name="koripuri"

4. Identify data type of variable result
a=42
b="42"
c=42.0
result=a+int(b)+c
sol:float

5.Simple Arithmetic with Numeric Types

Write a Python code to perform addition of two integers num1 = 10 and num2 = 20. Store the final sum in variable result. Also find the data type of the result.
num1=10
num2=20
result=num1+num2
type(result)
res:int

 6. Convert to Upper case
Write a code to convert all character of given text into upper-case. Store result in variable text_upper.

Hello, I am Datawars. I help users to learn Data Science

stringi="Hello, I am Datawars. I help users to learn Data Science"
text_upper=stringi.upper()


7.Convert to Lower case

Write a code to convert all character of given text into lower-case. Store the result in variable text_lower.

PYTHON IS A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

lowi="PYTHON IS A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE"
text_lower=lowi.lower()


8.String Concatenation

Write a Python code to concatenate the strings first_name as Alice and last_name as Brown. Don't forget to give a space in between first name and last name. Store the full name in variable full_name.

first_name= "Alice "
last_name= "Brown"
full_name=first_name+last_name


9.Type Conversion and Arithmetic

Write a Python code to take a float percentage as 85.5, convert it to an integer, and then add 10 to it. Store the final output in a variable result.

result=int(85.5)+10

10.Multi-line String Representation

Write a Python code to declare a variable student_info and assign it a multi-line string containing the student’s name as Alice, ID is 101, and score is 90. Print the variable student_info.
student_info="""Name: Alice
ID: 101
Score: 90"""
print(student_info)

11.Write a Python code to declare two boolean variables attended_classes as True and submitted_assignment as False. Use the and operator to check if both are True. Store the value in variable result.

12.String Indexing and Slicing

Write a Python code to declare a string student_name as Alice. Store the first character and the last three characters of the string in variables first_char and last_three_chars respectively.

student_name="Alice"
first_char=student_name[0]
last_three_chars=student_name[2]+student_name[3]+student_name[4]

13.Reverse a String

Write a Python code to reverse the string student_name as Alice and print the reversed name. Store the result in variable reversed_name.

student_name="Alice"
reversed_name=student_name[::-1]

14.Sum of Digits of a Student ID

Write a Python code to calculate the sum of the digits of a student’s ID (student_id = 123). Store the result in variable digit_sum.

student_id="123"
digit_sum=int(student_id[0])+int(student_id[1])+int(student_id[2])

15.Compute Final Score

Write a Python code to calculate the final score of a student by taking their exam_score as 90 and assignment_score as 40. Multiply the exam_score by 0.6 and the assignment_score by 0.4, then add them together. Store the result in variable final_score.

exam_score=90
assignment_score=40
final_score=exam_score*0.6 + assignment_score*0.4
